*** Setuid e setgid ***
Ferramenta de segurança que permite aos users executar determinados programas com privelégios.

When the kernel runs an executable file that has its “setuid” or “setgid” permis-
sion bits set, it changes the effective UID or GID of the resulting process to the
UID or GID of the file containing the program image rather than the UID and
GID of the user that ran the command. The user’s privileges are thus promoted for
the execution of that specific command only.
