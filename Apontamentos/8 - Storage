*** Linux recipe ***
Run sudo fdisk -l to list the system’s disks and identify the new drive.

Then run any convenient partitioning utility to create a partition table for the drive.
For drives 2TB and below, install a Windows MBR partition table. cfdisk is the easiest utility for this, but you can also use fdisk, sfdisk, parted, or gparted. Larger disks require a GPT partition table, so you must partition with parted or its GNOME GUI, gparted. gparted is a lot easier to use but isn’t usually installed by default.

Put all the drive’s space into one partition of unspecified or “unformatted” type.
Do not install a filesystem. Note the device name of the new partition before you leave the partitioning utility; let’s say it’s /dev/sdc1.

Next, run the following command sequence, selecting appropriate names for the volume group (vgname), logical volume (volname), and mount point. (Examples of reasonable choices: homevg, home, and /home.)
Prepare for use w/LVM:
	$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sdc1
Create volume group:
	$ sudo vgcreate vgname /dev/sdc1
Create logical volume:
	$ sudo lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n volname vgname
Create filesystem:
	$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vgname/volname
Create mount point:
	$ sudo mkdir mountpoint
Set mount opts, mntpoint:
	$ sudo vi /etc/fstab

In the /etc/fstab file, copy the line for an existing filesystem and adjust it. The device to be mounted is /dev/vgname/volname. If your existing fstab file identifies volumes by UUID, replace the UUID= xxx clause with the device file; UUID identification is not necessary for LVM volumes.

Finally, run sudo mount mountpoint to mount the filesystem.
