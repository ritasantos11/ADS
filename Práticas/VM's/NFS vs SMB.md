## NFS
With a good network, throughput it disgustingly fast and at the same time less CPU intensive on the server.
NFS uses the host-based authentication system. This means that every user on an authenticated machine can access a specific share.
NFS offers a better performance and is unbeatable if the files are medium sized or small. If the files are large enough the timings of both methods get closer to each other. Linux and Mac OS owners should use NFS instead of SMB.
NFS is the “Network File System” for Unix and Linux operating systems. It allows files to be shared transparently between servers, desktops, laptops etc. It is a client/server application that allows a user to view, store and update files on a remote computer as though they were on their own computer. Using NFS, the user or a system administrator can mount all or a portion of a file system.


## SAMBA
Também dá para windows.
SMB provides a user-based authentication. 
Most Windows users are forced to use SMB.
CIFS is the “Common Internet File System” used by Windows operating systems for file sharing. CIFS uses the client/server programming model. A client program makes a request of a server program (usually in another computer) for access to a file or to pass a message to a program that runs in the server computer. The server takes the requested action and returns a response. CIFS is a public or open variation of the Server Message Block Protocol (SMB) developed and used by Microsoft, and it uses the TCP/IP protocol.
